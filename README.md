### Mathematical Models

#### 1. Ship Arrival Process
- **Poisson Process**:
  - Configurable arrival rate (Œª = ships/hour)
  - Inter-arrival times: Exponential distribution f(t) = Œªe^(-Œªt)
  - Random ship class assignment based on distribution

#### 2. Service Time Calculation
```
Total Service Time = (Number of Containers / Berth Productivity) + 
                   Pilotage Time + 
                   Mooring/Unmooring Time
```
- **Container Processing**:
  - Continuous processing during service time
  - Real-time income/cost calculation

#### 3. Queue Management
- **Queue Discipline**:
  - First-Come-First-Served (default)
  - Optional Priority-based (Large > Medium > Small)
- **Queue Visualization**:
  - Automatic multi-row layout for large queues
  - Visual ship class indicators

#### 4. Weather System
- **Weather Events**:
  - Random occurrence based on probability
  - Duration: Uniform distribution between configurable bounds
- **Operational Impact**:
  - Complete halt of all port operations
  - No ship movements or cargo operations during bad weather
  - Visual weather warnings

#### 5. Financial Model
```
Income = Œ£(Containers Handled √ó Income per Container)
Costs = (Œ£(Containers Handled √ó Cost per Container)) + 
        (Monthly Maintenance Cost / 43,200)  # 30 days in minutes
Profit = Income - Costs
Profit Margin = (Profit / Income) √ó 100%
```
